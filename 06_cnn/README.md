# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

* [Week 6 CNN Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1aN0uLSKF1nR4gmBbDhYI1J9VI6nm-rNUmuhgeGiGaEI/edit?usp=sharing)

## Session A: What is CNN?

### Objectives:
* Understand when and why you might train your own model from scratch versus use a pre-trained model or transfer learning.
* Learn about the Google “Quick, Draw!” dataset.
* Understand how to work with image data for training your own model.

## Session B: Doodle Classification

### Objectives
* Learn to train an image classifier (no convolutional layers) with ml5.js.
* Learn the distinction between different types of layers of a neural network, specifically “What is a convolutional layer?”
* Learn to feed the input of a graphics canvas into a machine learning model.
